Creating Shortcuts in Ubuntu
=====================================================

To create shortcuts to important applications which you seldom use from the command-line requires
you to install few additional packages and then run a special command to create a shortcut.

1. Open a terminal  or press Ctrl+Alt+T
2. sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommneds gnome-panel
3. gnome-desktop-item-edit â€“-create-new ~/Desktop
 
   Enter the description in the following manner:

	Type: Application
        Name: FreePascalIDE
        Command: gnome-terminal --title="Free Pascal" --geometry=80x40 --hide-menubar -e fp-2.4.4
        Comment: FreePascalIDE

4. Press OK

You will find a FreePascal Launcher icon in your desktop and play around it as any other application programs that comes pre-installed with
the system.
